Prerequisites:

Node.js (v14 or later)

NPM (Node Package Manager)

MongoDB (local instance or a cloud instance from MongoDB Atlas)

npm install
3. Install Frontend Dependencies:
Navigate to the client directory and install the required npm packages.

Bash

cd ../client
npm install
4. Set Up Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the server directory and add the following configuration. Replace the placeholder with your actual MongoDB connection string.

Code snippet

# .env file in the /server directory

# Port for the backend server
PORT=8080

# Your MongoDB Connection URI
MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@your-cluster.mongodb.net/expense-app
5. Run the Application:
You can run both the frontend and backend servers concurrently from the root directory using the concurrently package.

From the root project directory, run:

Bash

npm run dev
This will start:

The React development server on http://localhost:3000

The Node.js backend server on http://localhost:8080 (or the port you specified in .env)
